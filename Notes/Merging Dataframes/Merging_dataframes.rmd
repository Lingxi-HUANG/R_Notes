## MERGING DATAFRAMES 

### Import data into RStudio
```{r}
GPA <- read.csv(".../.../GPA.csv", header = T)
DOB <- read.csv(".../.../DOB.csv", header = T)
Postal <- read.csv(".../.../Postal Code.csv", header = T)
```

### Merge GPA and DOB
Merge the first two dataframes with only overlapping observations
```{r}
M1 <- merge(GPA, DOB)
View(M1)
```

Merge the first two dataframes with all observations where empty values to be reflected with NA
all = TRUE or FALSE. Default setting is FALSE. If it is TRUE, merge will include observations that are not necessarily exist in two dataframes. 
```{r}
M2 <- merge(GPA, DOB, all = TRUE)
View(M2)
```

### Merge dataframes which column names needed to be mapped and specificed
By default the data frames are merged on the columns with names they both have, but separate specifications of the columns can be given by by.x and by.y. 
```{r}
M3 <- merge(M2, Postal, by.x = c("Name", "Gender"), by.y = c("col.1", "col.2"), all = TRUE)
View(M3)
```
