# R Coding Notes
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-R-blue)

While a newbie of R, I am often forgetting the structure of some functions, so I figure the best way to this is to put up a repository that contains my coding examples of R so I can reference back in the future. 

This repository stores notes of R programming and my previous works covering topics of data cleaning and data visualization, as well as external R resources. 

When making this repository, I am very grateful to [this github example](https://github.com/erikaduan/r_tips/blob/master/README.md) and the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) because they lighted up my passion to embark on my own R and github journey.
