# R Programming Notes
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-R-blue)

As a newbie of R programming, I am putting up a repository that contains my coding examples of R so I can reference back in the future. 

This repository stores notes of R programming and my previous works covering topics of data cleaning and data visualization. 

When making this repository, many thanks to [this github example](https://github.com/erikaduan/r_tips/blob/master/README.md) and the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) because it was these two that lighted up my passion to embark on my own github journey.
